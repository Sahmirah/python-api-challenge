# python-api-challenge

## Introduction 

This challenge was broken down into two parts. For the first part (WeatherPy), I used OpenWeatherMap API and citipy Python Library to create multiple scatter plots that compared the difference between temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed in the northern and southern hemisphere. I had to compute linear regression for each plot in order to determine if there was a relationship between the values. 
For the second part (VacationPy), I had utlized geoViews Python Library and Geoapify API to find the humidity of citites across the world. Then, I was tasked to find a list of cities that met my ideal weather conditions and locate hotels within a 10,000 radius. 

## Softwares Used 

For this assignment I utilized: 
1. jupyter notebooks
2. Citipy Python Library
3. OpenWeatherMap API
4. geoViews Python Library
5. Geoapify API
